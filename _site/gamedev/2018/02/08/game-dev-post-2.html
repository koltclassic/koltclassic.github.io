<p>I started on another tutorial series, this time for a tower defense game (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beuoNuK2tbk&amp;list=PLPV2KyIb3jR4u5jX8za5iU1cqnQPmbzG0">link</a>). This tutorial is much more involved than the last game, as well as a fair amount longer. I’ve gotten to the point where I am working with pre-made assets. One aspect of this tutorial series that has been slightly frustrating has been the path creation for the enemies to follow. I wasn’t sure if everything had to be pixel perfect or not, which made things quite time consuming. Using pre-made assets has me excited to start trying out modifying existing assets or creating my own. Another thing that I thought was very interesting was how simple basic waypoint creation was. Making the waypoints and having the enemies follow them was much easier than I originally anticipated. The gist of the creation is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have an array of waypoints in a defined order from start to finish.</li>
  <li>Tell your enemy to move toward the first point.</li>
  <li>Once the enemy gets within a certain distance to the point, move to the next point.</li>
  <li>Rinse and repeat until the enemy gets to the end.</li>
  <li>Delete the enemy (which will later count against a total score, player health amount, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>There is still a lot to learn with this tower defense tutorial, but I am looking forward to digging deeper into it!</p>
